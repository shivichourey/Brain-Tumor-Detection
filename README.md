# Brain-Tumor-Detection
I developed this project to deepen my understanding of transfer learning and real-world medical image classification. By leveraging the power of VGG16, a well-known CNN architecture, and fine-tuning it on MRI image data, the model achieved high classification accuracy while remaining lightweight and practical.
